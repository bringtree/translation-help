Spoken language understanding (SLU) aims to extract the meaning
of the speech utterances. While understanding language is still considered
an unsolved problem, in the last decade, a variety of practical
goal-oriented conversational understanding systems have been built
for limited domains. These systems aim to automatically identify the
intent of the user as expressed in natural language, extract associated
arguments or slots, and take actions accordingly to satisfy the user’s
requests. In such systems, the speaker’s utterance is typically recognized
using an automatic speech recognizer (ASR).  Then the intent
of the speaker is identified from the recognized word sequence using
an SLU component. Finally, a dialog or task manager (DM) interacts
with the user (not necessarily in natural language) and helps the
user achieve the task that the system is designed to support.
