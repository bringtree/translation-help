WHAT IS LEFT TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN ATIS?
第一部分：
One of the main data resources used in many studies over the
past two decades for spoken language understanding (SLU) research
in spoken dialog systems is the airline travel information system
(ATIS) corpus. Two primary tasks in SLU are intent determination
(ID) and slot filling (SF). Recent studies reported error rates below
5% for both of these tasks employing discriminative machine learning
techniques with the ATIS test set. While these low error rates
may suggest that this task is close to being solved, further analysis
reveals the continued utility of ATIS as a research corpus. In this paper,
our goal is not experimenting with domain specific techniques or
features which can help with the remaining SLU errors, but instead
exploring methods to realize this utility via extensive error analysis.
We conclude that even with such low error rates, ATIS test set still
includes many unseen example categories and sequences, hence requires
more data. Better yet, new annotated larger data sets from
more complex tasks with realistic utterances can avoid over-tuning
in terms of modeling and feature design. We believe that advancements
in SLU can be achieved by having more naturally spoken data
sets and employing more linguistically motivated features while preserving
robustness due to speech recognition noise and variance due
to natural language.Index Terms— spoken language understanding, ATIS, discriminative
